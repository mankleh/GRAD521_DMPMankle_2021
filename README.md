## Context Of the Project for this DMP:

This project is to provides an analysis on the numerical modeling of a small-scale wave energy converter (WEC). A crucial step in the design process of WECs is the numerical modeling. With large-scale modeling, frequency domain modeling is typically used. This calculates the hydrodynamic coefficients of WEC bodies using linear wave theory. The benefits to using frequency domain modeling is that it has a relatively low computational cost. With small-scale WECs, frequency-domain modeling may not accurately represent the nonlinear interactions the small-scale WEC might experience in a range of wave conditions. This is due to the relative size of the small-scale WEC and its interactions with incoming waves of the same magnitude as the large-scale WEC. Linear wave theory will not always apply to smaller WECs, which is why time-domain modeling might be the better option when designing small-scale WECs. The goal of this project is to understand if frequency-domain modeling can be used with a small-scale WEC by comparing the performance of three different hull-shapes for a two-body point absorber WEC.
